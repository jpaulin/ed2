# ed2

*an ed-like editor*

This project is a fully functional text editor in a relatively small amount of code.
I wrote it because I like text editors, I like coding, and I love learning how to
build things through experience. You may find it interesting if you also like these
things.

The `ed2` binary feels extremely similar to the old school
[`ed`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_%28text_editor%29)
text editor, which
is a non-visual line-based editor. This means you *do not* see the file contents by
default as you edit them. Somewhat like a shell interface, you think in terms of
typing in commands followed by a few lines of output. The non-visual nature of
`ed` and `ed2` make them appear primitive. However, they do have some nice features
such as regular expression searching and sophisticated replacements.
