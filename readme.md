*an ed-like editor*

"Who is ed and why are you making an editor like him?"

"For fun!"

Also to learn what it's like to build a text editor. I
have a dream of one day maybe writing a better one.
This one is a learning tool based on the
original unix ed text editor
[`ed`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_%28text_editor%29).
